# 222-4-simulation

Write a Java program to perform a simulation of interactions between wolfs and deers. The wilderness is modeled as a rectangular area indexed by i and j. At the beginning, each cell contains either a wolf or a deer. At each time step, each animal moves randomly to a neighbour cell. If a wolf moves into a cell containing a deer, it eats it. The same happens if a deer moves to a cell containing a wolf; it is eaten. If an animal moves to cell containing the same animal, they stay where they are. 

Provides a visualization of your simulation through several time steps.

The mark distribution is as follows. 
  Modeling the wilderness: 2 marks, 
  modeling each animal: 1 mark each, 
  simulation is working as expected: 2 marks; 
  the remaining 4 marks will be for each non-trivial test created and passed, properly commenting your code, and writing code that is efficient, e.g., no need to loop through cells that do not contain any animal.
